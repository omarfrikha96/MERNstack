# `Luke APIwalker`

By reading the Star Wars API documentation, create a User Interface that does the following tasks:

1-Create a dropdown menu that allows the user to choose the resource they are looking for

2-Next to the dropdown menu, create an input field that accepts a number that will be used to query a specific id.

3-Add a button to allow them to send a request to the API.

4-On submission, navigate to the appropriate route and render at least 4 attributes for that specific resource.

5-If the request is unsuccessful, create an error message that says "These aren't the droids you're looking for" with a picture of Obi-Wan Kenobi.

6-NINJA BONUS: If the resource is "people", output the name of the character's homeworld (you may need to make another request)
